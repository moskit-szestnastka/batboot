# BATboot
Batch file that boots batch operating systems.

## How to use it
When you open the batch file, you see this:\

You have to choose between autoboot and the boot menu.
Autoboot tries to find a bootable batch OS in the directories C, A and B.
If it fails, it shows this:\

If it finds a batch OS, it just starts it and closes BATboot
The boot menu is diffrent. It shows you this:\

If you choose to boot from a drive, it asks you for a folder name, CD's into it, and starts the batch OS.
If you choose to boot from a bootfile (batch OS ZIP), it asks you for it's filename, extracts the OS, and starts it.
